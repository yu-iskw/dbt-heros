# Safety Rules (Admin)

1. **Safety Mode Compliance**: ALWAYS check `LIGHTDASH_TOOL_SAFETY_MODE` before performing write operations.
2. **User Confirmation**: ALWAYS obtain explicit user confirmation before any destructive action (e.g., `delete_member`).
3. **UUID Verification**: Double-check UUIDs before executing destructive tools.
